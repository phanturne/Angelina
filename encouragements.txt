You are doing awesome!
Life is tough, but you’re tougher!
Don’t stress. You got this!
Good luck today! I know you are going to do great.
Hang in there!
Sending some good vibes and happy thoughts your way!
I know things are difficult right now, but I also know you’ve got what it takes to get through it.
Sending good thoughts your way—I believe in you and don’t doubt for a minute that you will kill it.
I believe in you! And unicorns. But mostly you.
What you’re going through right now is hard, but I’m rooting for you every minute of every day.
You got this! Take it from me. I’m very wise and stuff.
Just sending you a quick note to let you know that you’re on my mind and in my prayers.
Thinking of you, and trusting that this difficult time is just a stepping stone along the path to something better.
This totally sucks, but you totally don’t suck!
I’m so sorry you’re going through a difficult time. I don’t know what to say, except that I care about you, and I’m here for you.
Just wanted to send you a smile today.
Stop beating yourself up. You are a work in progress, which means you get there a little at a time, not all at once.
Don’t let anyone dull your sparkle.
This, too, shall pass. And you are going to look back on this period in your life and be so glad that you never gave up.
You are braver than you believe, stronger than you seem, and smarter than you think.
Today will never come again. Look forward to tomorrow.
Take a deep breath; it’s just a bad day, not a bad life.
Every day may not be a good day, but there is something good in every day.
Believe in yourself, because I believe in you!
Storms don’t last forever!
Today’s a good day to have a great day.
Keep your sunny side up, keep yourself beautiful, and indulge yourself.
